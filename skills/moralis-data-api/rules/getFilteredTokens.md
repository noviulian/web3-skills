# Returns a list of tokens that match the specified filters and criteria

Fetch a list of tokens across multiple chains, filtered and ranked by dynamic on-chain metrics like volume, price change, liquidity, holder composition, and more. Supports advanced filters (e.g. “top 10 whales hold <40%”), category-based inclusion/exclusion (e.g. “exclude stablecoins”), and time-based analytics. Ideal for token discovery, investor research, risk analysis, and portfolio tools. Each token returned includes detailed trading metrics as well as on-chain and off-chain metadata.
